problem: finding a location for a pharmacy in Orlando, Florida.

background: Florida has been one of the states hardest hit by the latest wave of COVID-19, so the addition of another pharmacy could help with the supply and
            accessibility of medicine and masks in an area that most needs it
            
use of data to solve problem: use the foursquare API to find out which neighbourhoods or boroughs have the least amount of pharmacies, which will then allow me 
                              to find the ideal neighbourhood(s) to put it in.
