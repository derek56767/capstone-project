Background: Florida has been one of the states hardest hit by the latest wave of COVID-19. As a result, pharmacies all over the state are likely short in supply and have trouble serving an increased number of peopleas a result. Thus, the addition of another pharmacy could help with the supply and accessibility of medicine and masks in an area that most needs it. This addition of a pharmacy will not only benefit people living close to the new location, but pharmacists who are looking for a location to conduct their business. This will also be beneficial to people who live further away from pharmacies, as the new location will reduce the distance and enhance accessibility for more people.

Problem trying to solve: Finding an ideal location for a pharmacy in Greater Orlando, Florida that can serve more people in a way that makes medicine and masks more accessible and possibly reduce the likelihood of infection as a result.


Use of data to solve problem: 
step 1: extract data location about Greater Orlando from a website such as Wikipedia to find out how Greater Orlando is divided.
step 2: use Nominatim from geocoder to find out approximate coordinates for each division of Greater Orlando.
step 3: use the Foursquare API to find out where pharmacies can be found in each division, and thus, all over Greater Orlando.
step 4: map data using Folium
step 5: use dataframes from pandas to take data from Foursquare to find the frequency of pharmacies.
step 6: use the data from the dataframes to split areas into clusters based on frequency of pharmacies.
step 7: use folium once again to see clusters
step 8: compare data between divisions of Greater Orlando and determine conclusions.
